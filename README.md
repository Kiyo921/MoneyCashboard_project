# MoneyCashboard Project
This project is the first solo project, a 7day hackathon at CodeClan in Edinburgh
## The Brief
Over the next week you have the chance to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

- Ruby fundamentals
- TDD
- OOP
- Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
- Databases with CRUD actions

Your assignment is an opportunity to practice all or some of these principles. Next Thursday you can do a short presentation on what you have achieved and learned.


## Project Description 

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include merchant name e.g. Tesco and value ) which has an associated Tag (e.g. ‘food’). It would then be able to track a total. Your Account could then be displayed in a view.

Suggested MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display all transactions
- Display total expenditure
- Display total expenditure by tag

Possible further functionality:
- CRUD actions for the transactions
- Create route that sends down Account data as JSON
